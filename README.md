# Howdy-World-Tech-Blog
Howdy World,\
This is the first entry in a new tech blog which will explore how to rethink technogy in terms of bussiness. In fact this blog will be an example how we can rethink technology, as GitHub is used for version control; I am experimenting using it with the Markdown language, to host my blog. This way I can keep the code examples right by the blog, which I think will open a lot of possibilities with how we interact with code.
